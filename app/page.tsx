        <Heading title="Senior front-end developer in Paris who likes interfaces ðŸ’…">
          With a decade of experience as a frontend developer, I bring a deep passion for crafting
          engaging web interfaces and enhancing user experiences with ReactJS and Typescript. I take
          pride in my contributions to projects such as MyCanal, the migration of Leboncoin and the
          design system for Welcome to the Jungle. I enjoy contributing to both product and
          technical decisions and actively participating in shaping future developments.
